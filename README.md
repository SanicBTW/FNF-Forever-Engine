# FNF-Forever-Engine

This repo is an attempt to port FE to HTML5

Alright, I got this working but it has a couple of bugs:

- Stage: This one is HScript's fault or code fault, I don't know I haven't really checked this one too deep
- Camera and characters break after playing 2 songs: After I fixed the error of not being able to play another song this showed up, dont know how to fix it

And that's all, currently on commit [4a01352](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FNF-Forever-Engine/commit/4a0135297e8f0c878f179aab49c60aefbc262257) latest one at the moment.

I will try my best to stick with the updates

# These changes are not from Forever Engine official repo, just some extra changes I wanted to add

Latest update:

- Avoid crashing when not finding the specified chart

- Added camera movement on note direction

- Pause substate (Suggested by Levi and already thought on making it) - although the substate is in the states -> substates folder it isnt official
