# FNF-Forever-Engine

This repo is an attempt to port FE to HTML5

Alright, I got this working but it has a couple of bugs:

- Stage: This one is HScript's fault or code fault, I don't know I haven't really checked this one too deep
- FlxGraphic issues: rarely happens, but I think it happens more frequently now, I will check it after the commit

And that's all, currently on commit [4a01352](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FNF-Forever-Engine/commit/4a0135297e8f0c878f179aab49c60aefbc262257) latest one at the moment.

I will try my best to stick with the updates
