# FNF-Forever-Engine

This repo is an attempt to port FE to HTML5

Alright, I got this working but it has a couple of bugs:

- Stage: This one is HScript's fault or code fault, I don't know I haven't really checked this one too deep

And that's all, currently on commit [4a01352](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FNF-Forever-Engine/commit/4a0135297e8f0c878f179aab49c60aefbc262257) latest one at the moment.

(Actually on latest commit)

I will try my best to stick with the updates

# These changes are not from Forever Engine official repo, just some extra changes I wanted to add

Latest update: 

- Pushes update to page (finished polishing)

- Added alphabet
- Updated song selection screen
- Updated pause substate
