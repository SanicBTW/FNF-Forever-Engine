# FNF-Forever-Engine

This repo is an attempt to port FE to HTML5

Alright, I got this working but it has a couple of bugs:

- Stage: This one is HScript's fault or code fault, I don't know I haven't really checked this one too deep
- Crashing when not finding chart: This one is easy however I don't really want to mess up with the loading for now

And that's all, currently on commit [4a01352](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FNF-Forever-Engine/commit/4a0135297e8f0c878f179aab49c60aefbc262257) latest one at the moment.

I will try my best to stick with the updates

Latest update:

Added a song selection screen (a background existed on development, gave a crash when coming back from song)

- You can select a week, a song and a difficulty
- Pressing enter will send you to playstate to play the song

Added triple trouble just for fun

These changes are not from Forever Engine official repo, just some extra changes I wanted to add
